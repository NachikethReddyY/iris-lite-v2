Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions

Last Updated: October 17, 2025

Welcome to the Iris Scanning App ("App"). This document outlines our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions ("Terms") for using the App. By using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App. We take your privacy seriously, especially since the App involves sensitive biometric data and cloud-based processing. Please read this carefully.

Privacy Policy

1. What Data We Collect

We collect the following data to provide the App's iris scanning and authentication services:





Biometric Data: Iris images and derived templates (numerical representations of your iris patterns) when you perform a scan. These are processed on your device and securely transmitted to cloud-based AI services for verification.



Device Data: Bluetooth connection details (e.g., device IDs) to communicate with the Magic Scanner camera module.



Usage Data: Anonymized logs (e.g., error codes, scan attempts) to improve the App. No personal identifiers are included.

We do not collect:





Raw iris images for storage.



Personal details like name, email, or location.



Any data for marketing or third-party sharing.

2. How We Use Your Data

Your data is used solely to:





Capture and process iris scans for authentication.



Enhance and verify iris images using AI-powered cloud services (Google Gemini API) for accurate matching.



Match iris templates against a stored template for verification.



Debug issues (e.g., Bluetooth errors) using anonymized logs.

3. Where Your Data Is Stored





On-Device Storage: Iris templates are encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption and stored in your device's secure storage (e.g., iOS Keychain or Android Keystore). Raw images are deleted immediately after processing.



Cloud Processing: Iris images are securely transmitted to Google Gemini API for AI-powered verification and matching. These images are processed in real-time and are not permanently stored by the cloud service. Google's privacy policies and data handling practices apply to this processing.



Bluetooth Transfer: Iris images are sent from the Magic Scanner to your device over a secure Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection with encryption enabled. No data is stored on the Magic Scanner after transfer.

4. Data Retention





Temporary Processing: Raw iris images are deleted from memory after processing (within seconds).



Templates: Encrypted iris templates are stored on your device until you choose to delete them via the App's "Delete All Data" option or uninstall the App.



Logs: Anonymized logs are kept for up to 30 days for debugging and then deleted.

5. Your Rights and Choices

You have full control over your data:





Consent: Before your first scan, you must explicitly consent to data collection. You can withdraw consent at any time by deleting your data or uninstalling the App.



Data Deletion: Use the "Delete All Data" option in Settings to remove all iris templates and logs instantly.



Access: You can request a copy of your stored template (in encrypted form) by contacting us (see Section 10).



Opt-Out: Stop using the App to prevent further data collection.

We comply with privacy laws like GDPR (EU) and BIPA (Illinois, USA). If you're in a region with specific biometric data laws, you have additional rights (e.g., to restrict processing or lodge complaints with a data protection authority).

6. Security Measures

We prioritize your data's security:





Encryption: Iris templates are encrypted with AES-256. Bluetooth transfers use BLE's secure pairing mode.



Cloud-Based AI Processing: Iris images are securely transmitted to Google Gemini API for verification. The service processes images in real-time without permanent storage.



Minimal Data: We collect only what's needed for the App to function.



No Sharing: Your data is never shared with third parties, sold, or used for purposes beyond authentication.

7. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for users under 16. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you're under 16, please do not use the App.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. We'll notify you via the App (e.g., a pop-up) before changes take effect. Continued use after updates means you accept the new terms.

2. Use of the App





Purpose: The App is for personal iris-based authentication using a Magic Scanner camera module.

4. Disclaimers





As-Is: The App is provided "as-is" without warranties. Iris scanning accuracy depends on lighting, camera quality, and user cooperation. We don't guarantee perfect results.



Risks: You use the App at your own risk. We're not liable for unauthorized access to your device or data breaches caused by your failure to secure your device.



Hardware: The App works with a Magic Scanner camera module. We're not responsible for hardware failures or compatibility issues.
