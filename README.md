## Configuration

### Environment Variables

No external API keys are required. The full iris pipeline runs locally.

### iOS Configuration

The app is configured to request Face ID permissions. The usage description is set in `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSFaceIDUsageDescription": "Iris-Auth uses Face ID for secure biometric authentication."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Features

- **On-Device Pipeline**: Capture, fusion, enhancement, and matching stay local
- **Encrypted Storage**: All sensitive data is encrypted using Expo Secure Store
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout after 24 hours (configurable)
- **Detailed Logs**: Local audit trail with confidence scores and sources
